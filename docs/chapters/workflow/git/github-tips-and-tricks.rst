GitHub Tips and Tricks
======================
Following are tips and tricks specific to GitHub. This might work similarly
on other platforms as well but no guarantees are made.

Managing Pull requests
----------------------
Using the Pull requests view located in the top bar on the GitHub page
(https://github.com/pulls) it is possible to view all Pull requests where:

* Your user is the creator.
* Your user is assigned.
* Your user is mentioned.
* Your user is requested for review.

This is a really neat way of getting the big picture of your engagement in
Pull requests. However, when reviewing a Pull request that Pull request
will no longer be listed in the "Review request" tab even when the review
requests changes. To work around this, make sure to assign your user to the
Pull request using "assign yourself" under "Assignees" to the right of the
comments field in the Pull request. This way the Pull request will still be
listed under "Assigned".
