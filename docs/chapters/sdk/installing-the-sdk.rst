Fetching and installing the SDK
===============================

Download the SDK for your hardware from the `PELUX website`_. The SDK is a very
huge file as it contains the whole sysroot for the project in addition to some
native tools. Depending on the internet connectivity speed it could take a
while.

Or you can of course build it yourself as described in :ref:`building-the-sdk`.
