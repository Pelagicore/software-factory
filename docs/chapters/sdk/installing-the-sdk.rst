Fetching and installing the SDK
===============================

Download the SDK for your hardware from the `PELUX website`_. The SDK is a very
huge file as it contains the whole sysroot for the project in addition to some
native tools. Depending on the internet connectivity speed it could take a
while.

Or you can of course build it yourself as described in :ref:`building-the-sdk`.

.. note:: Note that the version number at the end of the SDK download file is
          not the version of the SDK but in fact the version number of poky,
          which is the upstream Yocto distribution PELUX is using.
