Downloading and installing the SDK
==================================

Download the SDK for your hardware from the `PELUX website`_. The SDK is a very huge file as it
contains the whole sysroot for the project in addition to some native tools. Depending on the
internet connectivity speed it could take a while.

.. note:: Note that the version number at the end of the SDK download file is not the version of the SDK but in fact the version number of poky, which is the upstream Yocto distribution PELUX is using.
