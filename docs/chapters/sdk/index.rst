Software Development Kit
************************

PELUX provides a Software Development Kit (SDK), for quick and easy development of software
components for a PELUX (or PELUX-based) system. The SDK is mainly targeted towards service
implementers but can be used for developing applications and other kinds of software components as
well. The SDK installer script can be downloaded from `PELUX website`_. Each SDK installer is for a
specific target hardware platform.
