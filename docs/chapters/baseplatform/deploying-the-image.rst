Image names for PELUX targets
-----------------------------
* Intel NUC and ARP with Intel SMARC: ``core-image-pelux-intel-corei7-64.wic``
* Raspberry Pi 3: ``core-image-pelux-raspberrypi3.wic``

.. note:: Image names depend on the built image and the image might contain suffixes such as ``-dev``. An image is always either a ``-minimal`` or ``-qtauto-neptune`` image. For software update images, a ``.swu`` file exists.
