Obtaining a PELUX release
=========================

The following manifests can be used for a build:

* `pelux-intel.xml` - For building the `core-image-pelux` image for Intel
* `pelux-intel-qt.xml` - For building the `core-image-pelux-qt` image, which is the baseline with QtAS
* `pelux-rpi.xml` - For building the `core-image-pelux` image for Raspberry Pi 3

Variables:

* Manifest, refers to what `<manifest-name>.xml` file you want to use, for example `pelux-intel.xml`. Each hardware platform targeted by the PELUX reference has its own manifest describing what other git repositories are needed for the build.
* Image, refers to what version of PELUX should be built. Currently there are two versions: `core-image-pelux` and `core-image-pelux-qt`. The latter being a version that includes QtAS_ components that enable the NeptuneUI demo application.

Create a directory for the PELUX build. Instruct repo tool to fetch a manifest using the command `repo init`. In this context, branch denotes what branch of git repo `pelux-manifests` to use. Then make repo tool fetch all sources using the command `repo sync`.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/repo-init.sh
    :language: bash

When done fetching the sources, create a build directory and set up bitbake. TEMPLATECONF tells the `oe-init-build-env` script which path to fetch configuration samples from. Note that the example below get the template configuration for the Intel BSP, adapt the path according to your current BSP.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/repo-source.sh
    :language: bash

The script will create configs if there are no configs present, a message about created `conf/local.conf` and `conf/bblayers.conf` files is normal.


Finally, build the desired image. See the variables description above for information on the different images.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/bitbake.sh
    :language: bash
