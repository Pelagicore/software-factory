# How to contribute

We are happy to accept contributions. To be able to accept
contributions, we require:

* A developer certificate of origin, see http://developercertificate.org

In short this means that by adding a "Signed-off-by:" line to the
commit message you certify that you have the rights to contribute
that code to this project, but please read the linked website for a
more in depth description.

You can add such a line by committing like this: `git commit --signoff`,
for more technical info see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-am#git-am---signoff
